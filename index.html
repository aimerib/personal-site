      <div>
        Hello and welcome to my personal website! My name is Aimeri, and I am a
        software engineer with a diverse background and a passion for learning
        new things. Before becoming a software engineer, I worked for over 10
        years as a system administrator and devops engineer. While I enjoyed
        that work, I always had a fascination with software development and
        decided to make the switch in 2019. I am excited to be pursuing my
        passion and am constantly looking for ways to improve and learn more.
        One thing that sets me apart is my international background. I was born
        in the United States, but I spent 20 years growing up in Brazil and am
        fluent in Portuguese. This unique perspective has influenced my approach
        to software development and has given me a deeper understanding of
        different cultures and ways of thinking. In addition to my work as a
        software engineer, I am also a huge mental health advocate. I believe
        that mental health is just as important as physical health, and I strive
        to create a positive and supportive work environment for myself and
        those around me. Outside of work, family life is extremely important to
        me. I have a young son and am happily married. When I'm not coding, you
        can find me indulging in my many hobbies. I have more hobbies than I can
        count, and I love nothing more than picking up new ones. Currently, I've
        been fascinated with 3D printing, woodworking, electronics projects with
        the Arduino board, and baking. I'm always looking for new challenges and
        ways to express my creativity. Finally, I also have a military
        background, having served in the Navy reserves for 4 years. I believe
        that my time in the military has taught me valuable skills such as
        discipline, teamwork, and the importance of attention to detail, all of
        which have been invaluable in my career as a software engineer.

        As a software engineer with a never-ending thirst for learning, I have
        dabbled in a wide variety of languages and technologies, including
        Javascript, Elixir, Ruby, and Rust. My personal projects are a
        playground where I get to tinker and try out new ideas, and through
        them, I have been able to learn so much. Some of my projects are
        polished and production ready, like my text-adventure engine written in
        Rust that runs on the browser as well as many other desktop front-ends.
        This project was a true labor of love, and I poured countless hours into
        perfecting every last detail. On the other hand, some of my projects are
        just rough prototypes that I use to test out new concepts, like my sleep
        tracking application built with Elixir and Phoenix. This project is
        still a work in progress, but it has already taught me so much about
        Elixir and Phoenix, and I can't wait to see where it goes next. But it's
        not just the technical aspects of programming that I love. I find true
        joy in the creative process of bringing an idea to life, and that's why
        I love working on personal projects so much. Whether I'm creating a
        Javascript and Puppeteer engine for automated QA testing, or a CLI tool
        to help organize game projects in the style of Rust's cargo for the
        Playdate SDK, I get a rush from turning an idea into a real, tangible
        thing. Of course, most of my professional work is done in Rails, and I
        am highly proficient in it. But it's through my personal projects that I
        am able to explore new technologies and push myself to learn more. For
        me, learning is the most important aspect of being a software engineer,
        and every single one of my personal projects has helped me grow and
        become a better engineer. So, if you want to work with someone who is
        always looking to improve and learn new things, I'm your person!

        As a software engineer, I am constantly seeking new opportunities to
        learn, grow, and challenge myself. My projects section is a reflection
        of that spirit of exploration, showcasing a selection of my work that I
        am most excited about. From building a text-adventure engine to
        developing a platform for couples to strengthen their relationships,
        each of these projects has been an exciting opportunity to learn and
        grow as a software engineer. I hope you enjoy taking a look at my
        projects, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any
        questions or would like to know more about my work. Text Adventure
        Engine: One of my standout projects is a text-adventure engine written
        in Rust that runs on the browser as well as many other desktop
        front-ends. My goal with this project was to design and develop the
        engine from the ground up, and it was a true labor of love. I was able
        to utilize my skills in Rust to create a stable and efficient solution,
        and I am extremely proud of the final product. Game CLI: Another project
        that I am proud of is a CLI tool that I developed to help organize game
        projects in the style of Rust's cargo for the Playdate SDK. In this
        project, I tried to accomplish the goal of creating a tool that would be
        useful for game developers and would streamline their workflow. I was
        able to complete this project successfully, and the tool is now being
        used by game developers. CouplesConnect: In this project, I am building
        a platform for couples to have weekly check-ins and deepen their
        connection. It is written in Ruby on Rails, and it is still a work in
        progress. My goal with this project is to build out the core
        functionality of the platform and to create a SwiftUI companion
        application in the future. I am excited about the potential impact this
        platform could have on helping couples strengthen their relationships,
        and I am looking forward to seeing it grow and evolve. GIF Generating
        Javascript QA Engine: Another project that I have worked on is a
        Javascript and Puppeteer engine for automated QA testing. This engine
        allows users to easily take scrolling screenshots of webpages, which can
        be extremely useful for testing and debugging purposes. My goal with
        this project was to design and implement a tool that would be efficient
        and reliable, and I was able to utilize my skills in Javascript and
        automation to achieve this. I hope you enjoy taking a look at my
        projects, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any
        questions or would like to know more about my work. I am always open to
        discussing new ideas and opportunities, and I would love to hear from
        you.
